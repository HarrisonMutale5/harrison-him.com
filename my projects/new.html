            <h1>what is Addictio</h1>
            <p>Addiction is defined as not having control over doing, 
                taking or using something to the point where it could be harmful to you.

                Addiction is most commonly associated with gambling, drugs, alcohol and smoking, 
                but it's possible to be addicted to just about anything, including:</p>
                <p>
                    <b>work</b> – some people are obsessed with their work to the extent that they 
                    become physically exhausted; if your relationship, family and social life 
                    are affected and you never take holidays, you may be addicted to work.<br />
                    <b>internet</b> – as computer and mobile phone use has increased, so too have 
                    computer and internet addictions; people may spend hours each day and night 
                    surfing the internet or gaming while neglecting other aspects of their lives.<br />
                   <b> solvents</b> – volatile substance abuse is when you inhale substances such as glue, aerosols, 
                    petrol or lighter fuel to give you a feeling of intoxication 
                </p>
                <h2>What causes addictions?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are lots of reasons why addictions begin. In the case of drugs, 
                    alcohol and nicotine, these substances affect the way you feel, both physically 
                    and mentally. These feelings can be enjoyable and create a powerful urge to use 
                    the substances again.

                    Gambling may result in a similar mental "high" after a win, followed by a strong 
                    urge to try again and recreate that feeling. This can develop into a habit that 
                    becomes very hard to stop.
                    
                    Being addicted to something means that not having it causes withdrawal symptoms, 
                    or a "come down". Because this can be unpleasant, it's easier to carry on having or 
                    doing what you crave, and so the cycle continues.
                    
                    Often, an addiction gets out of control because you need more and more to satisfy 
                    a craving and achieve the "high".   
                </p>
                <h2>How addictions can affect you</h2>
                <p>The strain of managing an addiction can seriously damage your work life and relationships. 
                    In the case of substance misuse (for example, drugs and alcohol), an addiction can have 
                    serious psychological and physical effects.

                    Some studies suggest a person's risk of becoming addicted is partly genetic, but environmental 
                    factors, such as being around other people with addictions, are also thought to increase the risk.
                    
                    Behaviours such as substance misuse can be a way of blocking out difficult issues. 
                    Unemployment and poverty can trigger addiction, along with stress and emotional or professional pressure.</p>
